A collection of the greatest hits from the field of algorithm design

## Personal collection of algorithms
#### Implemented from scratch in _Python_ (probably **not** optimized, do not blame me!)

* [Karger's Min Cut](https://github.com/Zymrael/Algorithm-greatest-hits/blob/master/graph%20algorithms/Karger's%20min%20cut.py)
  Randomized algorithm to compute the _minimum cut_ in an undirected graph. Implemented on adjacency lists, currently poorly optimized **O(m^2)** time **O(m)** space
